(1) Using the Customer Table, select the CustomerName, ContactName, and Country.  Use ORDER BY to order by Country.  
Use LIMIT and OFFSET to get entries 11 through 20. Paste your SQL statement below. 

select CustomerName, ContactName, Country from Customers 
	order by Country 
        	limit 10
            	offset 10;

(2) Select all columns from the Customer table where the ContactName starts with A.  Paste your SQL statement below.

select * from Customers
	where ContactName >= 'A' and ContactName < 'B';

(3) Select all columns from the OrderDetails table where the ProductID is 51 and the quantity is greater than 10.
Paste your SQL statement below.

select * from OrderDetails
	where ProductID = 51
    	and 
        	Quantity > 10;

(4) Insert 3 rows into the Products table.  Note that you will have to specify a valid SupplierID and CategoryID, 
corresponding to rows from the Supplier and Category tables.  Paste your three SQL statements below.

insert into Products (ProductID, ProductName, SupplierID, CategoryID, Unit, Price)
	values 
    	(78, 'Walmart Ciabatta', 18, 3, 13, 3.24),
        (79, 'Bananas', 12, 7, 5, 3.25),
     	(80, 'Tortilas', 10, 2, 15, 1.58);

(5) Update the two top rows of the Products Table to increase the price by 1.50. (Get SQL to do the addition for you.)  Paste your SQL statement below.

update Products 
	set Price = Price + 1.5
      where
          ProductID <= 2

(6) Delete all rows of the Products Table where the price is less than 7.00. Paste your SQL statement below.

delete from Products 
	where Price < 7.00;
